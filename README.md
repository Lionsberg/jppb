# Jordan and Pete Publish a Book
  
We are planning a series of at least five meetings to focus on publishing a unique book, which aims to be the first ever trilogy published in this manner. Our ambitious goal is to accomplish this within the next 30 days. During these meetings, we have pledged to our network to document our process. We'll also explore automation opportunities to assist with various concurrent publishing projects. This initiative seeks to enhance our publishing process continually. We intend to start with collaborative writing in Markdown, often utilizing massive wiki technology, and then refine and automate the conversion of these files. Our ultimate aim is to streamline our publishing workflow, enabling us to bring more valuable and inspiring voices to the forefront. -- [Jordan Sukut](https://jordannicholas.org/) and [Peter Kaminski](https://peterkaminski.wiki/).
